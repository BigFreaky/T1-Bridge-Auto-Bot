# ü§ñ T1-Bridge-Auto-Bot

A powerful and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) tool for automating cross-chain bridging across multiple EVM-compatible networks, including a custom T1 Devnet. Built with Node.js, `ethers.js`, and `blessed` for a rich terminal experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Network Support**: Pre-configured for bridging between T1 Devnet, Sepolia, Arbitrum, and Base Sepolia.
- **Automated Bridging Cycles**: Set the number of bridging transactions and let the bot run automatically.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: View live transaction logs, wallet balances, and operational status at a glance.
- **Secure Configuration**: Keeps your sensitive private key separate from the main codebase using a `.env` file.
